1. Files:

Makefile (containing examples of how to run the code)
triangulation.py (library containing core functions)
augmentation_chr_pred.py (scaffold augmentation chromosome prediction)
augmentation_locus_pred.py (scaffold augmentation locus prediction)
karyotype.py (de novo karyotyping)
scaffold_chr.py (de novo chromosome scaffolding)
contig_positions.tab (data file containing hg19-mapped positions of Allpaths-LG/GAGE contigs, see Makefile)
README

2. Requirements:

Code was written in Python 2.7.2 on a 64-bit Linux operating system.
The following external Python modules are required: numpy, scipy, scikit-learn.

3. Design notes:

Code was designed such that all triangulation algorithms (augmentation+de novo) are contained in the triangulation.py module,
in addition to some helper functions. Each of the other scripts is executable and interfaces with this module.
Scripts that perform heavy computations have been designed so they can be run in a distributed form either as multiple
processes on a single machine or multiple processes on multiple machines.
Note that some scripts currently require loading large matrices into RAM.
karyotype.py and scaffold_chr.py use randomizations, but utilize seeds for reproducible results.
